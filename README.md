# Two Wheels Motorcycle Tours

Two Wheels Tour is an imaginary company specialized in providing multi-day motorcycle tours and motorcycle rental services in Ireland. This website was targeted to motorcyclists from Ireland and abroad interested in riding along experienced riders while getting to know a bit of history behind each landmark and town visited. 

The company would provide motorcycle rental services for people who cannot bring their own motorcycle or would like to experience riding a different motorcycle than their own.

## Features 
Each page is divided into 3 main segments: header, content and footer. Each segment provides useful information about the bunsiness and easy navigation access to all pages and external links.

### Existing Features
- __Header__
  - The header contains the Navigation Bar including the Two Wheels Motorcycle Tours and links to all 3 pages.

- __Navigation Bar__

  - Featured on all three pages, the navigation bar is fully responsive. On the left hand side it contains links to the landing page (logo). On the right hand side, it contains links to the pages: Motorcycle Tours, Rent a Motorcycle and Contact Us. This allows for practical navigation without the need to rely on browser's navigation controls. 
  
  - Each link has a "mouse over" colour that corresponds to the background colour of that page. When the user clicks on a link, it's background colour is highlighted and it matches and integrates to the design of the corresponding page, looking similar to "tab navigation".

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
